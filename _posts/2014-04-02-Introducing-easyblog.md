I noticed that I merely wrote nothing since I migrate my blog to Github Pages. That's strange. jekyll is an awful tool, and Github Pages is the best place for programmers to write posts, since jekyll supports GFM, fully customizable, and allows user to include script in posts. 

What's more,

> jekyll let you write your post in your favorate editor, and submit your post using `git`

But how about images? I have to commit image to our repo, and write its link myself, or upload them to dropbox, then paste its link to our blog.
