##What does "hyspace" mean?

###hyspace

`[haɪspeis]`

It's my internet nickname and ID. 'hy' is represented for '幻影' in Chinese, which means 'Ghost' or 'Vision' in English. I can't remember why I've chosen that name, maybe because it's looked kind of smart or somehow.

But after all, it's means 'hyper' instead now. `hyper space`, looked nice, doesn't it?
